# Kepler's Quest

A realistic orbital mechanics simulation engine that demonstrates planetary motion using Kepler's laws of planetary motion.

## Features

- **Realistic Orbital Physics**: Implements Kepler's laws with proper orbital elements
- **Interactive Solar System**: Watch Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter orbit the Sun
- **Visual Effects**: 
  - Elliptical orbital paths showing true eccentricities
  - Colored orbital trails with fade effects
  - Glowing celestial bodies with realistic colors
  - Professional space-themed interface

## Controls

- **Pause/Resume**: Stop or continue the simulation
- **Toggle Trails**: Show/hide orbital trails
- **Speed Control**: Adjust simulation speed from 0.125x to 16x
- **Reset**: Restart the simulation

## Technical Details

- Built with pure JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas
- 60fps smooth animation
- Accurate Kepler equation solving for orbital mechanics
- Realistic planetary data including:
  - Orbital periods (Mercury: 88 days, Earth: 365 days, Jupiter: 4333 days)
  - Orbital eccentricities creating visible elliptical shapes
  - Proper relative planet sizes and colors

## Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to start the simulation.

## Future Enhancements

This engine provides the foundation for:
- Spacecraft simulation and control
- Mission planning tools
- Orbital transfer calculations
- Educational astronomy applications
- Full space exploration games

## Physics Implementation

The simulation uses:
- Kepler's First Law: Elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus
- Kepler's Second Law: Planets sweep equal areas in equal times
- Kepler's Third Law: Orbital period squared is proportional to semi-major axis cubed
